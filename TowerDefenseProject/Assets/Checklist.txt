To do list by priority

✔️ - Waves (Crudely done, will want to revisit in the future)
✔️ - More enemies with different behaviors (Add mage and bosses in the future)
✔️ - Charge system on ultimate + Display Spcbar charge on UI (Probably will want to improve layout later)
✔️ - Placeholder menu (Took much more time than I thought because I ended up creating the multi-character system)
✔️ - Gold/shop with items like damage boosters, potions, weapon charge, base health increase, etc (Could be expanded on in the future, visuals will want to be improved)
✔️ - More waves (Add more waves and boss (Large powerful versions of normal enemies) waves at each 10 waves)
✔️ - Balance numbers

   - Different classes/characters
   - Real menu
   - Animations, sounds, particles, etc
   - (Maybe) Minimap/Warning indicator upon enemies getting close to base
